          AI and machine learning, the application offers personalized lessons,
          real-time feedback, and scenario-based training, ensuring that
          learners are well-prepared for on-road driving. The application's
          content is tailored to Indian road conditions, traffic norms, and
          driving etiquette, making it highly relevant and effective.
